# word-crossword-game
This project is a Word Crossword Game developed in Python. The program takes words entered by the user and hides them inside an alphabetical crossword grid. The player must then search the grid to find the hidden words.  This project demonstrates basic algorithm design, grid manipulation, and user interaction using Python.

How the Game Works:
The user enters one or more words.
The program creates a crossword-style grid.
The entered words are hidden inside the grid.
The remaining empty spaces are filled with random alphabetical characters.
The final grid is displayed for the player to solve.

Features:
Accepts user-entered words
Generates an alphabetical crossword grid
Randomly fills unused spaces with letters
Simple, text-based interface
Easy to understand and modify
